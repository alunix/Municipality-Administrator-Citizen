# Municipality Administrator Web Application

A web application that aims to faciliate some services offered by the municipality. 

The Administrator of each building will manage the citizens inhabitating the building he manages including the citizens personal details and payments required by each family. The application eases services related with reconstructions permits, parking permits, tax payments etc., by permitting the Administrator to submit documents online and complete the proccess online.

The Municipality Representative will view all Administrators, and by selecting any of them he can view their requests as well as the families inhabiting that building. He/She can also assign payments to be made by the Administrators (or more specifically the inhabitants of the building he/she administers)

Both Administrators and Municipality Representatives may set up meetings with each other. The Municipality Representative will even have the option to call for a common meeting in which he invites all Administrators at once. This may serve for informative meetings on new regulations or legal changes regarding them.

This Application will also include a view for the Citizens where they can view the taxes due, or communicate with the administrator for him to request a permit. The Citizen however can not directly communicate with the Municipality Representative to enable:
1. a fair division of the workload between administrative levels
2. request filtering, since the administrator has a better knowledge of the legal basis and can minimize the number of incorrect requests done by a citizen.

Health Application

A mobile app that saves patient details, including health diagnosis and prescriptions. 
It offers different services for the patient and doctors: 
1. A doctor can set the next appointment for his patients, can give them a prescription and assign the pills they need to take and timings.
2. A patient will regularly get notifications when he needs to take a pill, or be alerted when his doctor sets an appointment. He can also request an appointment with a doctor, see his health history, or request an ambulance in case of an emergency.

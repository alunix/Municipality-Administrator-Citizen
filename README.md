Day 1 -- 13.march.2018     

We discussed ideas about what we should do.
Many options came to the table.

1. Firstly we exchanged contact information with each other such as emails and a WhatsApp group that we created for ease of communication.
2. We determined to meet twice a week according to our time schedules.
3. Our communication channels are as follow : Whatsapp , E-mail, Google Drive and Evernote.
4. 
Each team member came up with several ideas such as : 
    * 
Erida: Municipality administrator Web Application
        * This web application aims to facilitate services offered by the municipality. Every building administrator will manage the citizens inhabiting the building he manages, with the option to add and remove families. The app easies services related to reconstruction permits, parking permits, tax payments, etc.
    * 
Erida: Telekom Albania User Administration Software
        * A software that manages user information for GSM, E, 3G, LTE coverage, instead of the specific apps they use for each at the moment. The app is also used for call barring, data barring and other services performed by the Public Land Mobile Network Company.
    * 
Elvi: Police Radar Control
        * A smartphone application that using the API from Google Maps, this app finds the route from your current location to a destination of your choice, and shows the police patrols using radar speed cameras that are along the way. This is based on users reporting these radar speed cameras, that will include further information like how many reports have been made for a specific patrol, when was it last reported, etc.
    * 
Elvi: Management System for a Law Studio
        * A Web App that records clients' needs to create new court hearings and court requests based on a problem they have. The client selects the type of problem he has and writes a detailed description of his problem, and based on this information the lawyer then writes an official request to the court.
    * 
Jorgel: Efficient Transport Cost Calculation
        * A software that aims to find an optimal price of a product by calculating transport cost based on kilometers covered and weight for each dispatchers. The calculation is done through daily data processing. The final goal is to maximize profit and minimize cost.
    * 
Erida & Jorgel: Pune ka, por s'ka profesioniste!
        * A mobile application which facilitates finding technical help for various problems. The client uses the app to call an electrician, plumber, or other technicians directly to his home or business using location services.
    * 
Giuliano: Container Management System. 
        * A Web application that helps count the number of big shipping containers like MSC that come daily in Port Authority.This web application also allows for a separate system that checks the entrance and exits of working personnel.
    * 
Erida: Health Application:
        * A mobile app that saves patient details, including health diagnosis and prescriptions. It offers different services for the patient and doctors. A doctor can set the next appointment for his patients, can give them a prescription and assign the pills they need to take and timings. A patient will regularly get notifications when he needs to take a pill, or be alerted when his doctor sets an appointment. He can also request an appointment with a doctor, see his health history, or request an ambulance in case of an emergency.

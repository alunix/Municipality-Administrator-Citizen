Municipality Administrator Citizen Web App

Municipality Administrators Web Application is a software that aims to facilitate 
services offered by the municipality. 
It has three main users in mind: the Citizen, the building Administrator, 
and the Municipality Employee. 
It provides a platform for easier communication between these actors and eases 
some already-available services by offering them online. 
"BAQ", its acronym in Albanian, allows Citizens to send complaints to the Municipality 
regarding problems they face, or file requests online for parking permits, 
reconstruction permits, etc. without leaving the comfort of their house or 
having to wait in line for hours. 
The same functionalities are available to the Administrator with the addition of 
managing the monthly fees the citizens in his/her building ought to pay, 
as well as applying for the Administrator status online by submitting the required 
documents and getting their approval online later on. 
The Municipality Employee can read complaints and take appropriate action, 
accept/ deny requests, and see the list of Administrators for each building 
in the city also portrayed in a map.
